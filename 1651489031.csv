We are unable to sponsor or take over sponsorship of employment Visas in the U.S. or U.K. at this time.  About GiveDirectly  GiveDirectly (GD) aims to reshape international giving – and millions of lives – by providing cash grants directly to the world’s poorest. The Brookings Institution estimates that $70B of cash transfers would be required to eliminate the poverty gap; the aid sector currently spends $135B each year, much of it on evidence-free interventions. GiveDirectly wants to change that, establishing cash transfers as a benchmark for foreign aid – as the index fund is a benchmark for the financial industry – and in the process accelerating the end of extreme poverty.  GD has raised over $700M since launching in 2011, delivered cash to more than 1 million people, and launched offices in 10 countries. We’ve also supported large-scale, experimental research that indicates strong recipient impact of our programs. As a result, GD has been celebrated as one of the most innovative non-profit companies by Fast Company , while the growing cash transfer movement (and GD’s leading role within it) have been featured in the New York Times Magazine , This American Life , Foreign Affairs , and The Economist .  We’re looking for exceptional talent to grow our collaborative, diverse team.

320,Junior GOlang Developer,Betsys,"Prague, Czechia",N/A,"Chceš se stát seniorem v Go? Zajímá Tě problematika psaní aplikací pro multi-thread? Chceš navrhovat vlastní řešení problému?  Chceš být součástí vznikající Go komunity? Pak hledáme právě tebe.  Co Tě u nás čeká? Zpočátku bys začal pracovat na menších úkolech, především UNIT testech. Na těch si osaháš, jak tady Go píšeme a jak naše aplikace fungují. Jakmile si aplikace osaháš, přejdeme k větším úkolům zabývajících se refactoringem. Zde už budeš sám navrhovat řešení, které spolu budeme konzultovat. Zpětnou vazbu ke kódu budeš dostávat skrze code review. Také spolu nastavíme individuální rozvojový plán, kde si vytyčíš cíle a to, jak je budeš plnit. Nejprve bude tento plán zaměřen především na Go ale poté už bude na tobě, v čem se budeš chtít rozvíjet.  Co budeš rozvíjet? BLS (“Betsys Live Source“) – slouží pro poskytování feedů (data o zápasech, např. změna kurzů sázek) třetím stranám. Pro komfort sázkařů je potřeba distribuovat data ve velmi krátkém čase – stovky milisekund. Systém v tuto chvíli prochází refactoringem. Mění se infrastruktura, aby byl systém škálovatelný. Vznikají nové komponenty v Go.  Replication Handler – replikuje WAL z PostgreSQL do RabbitMQ ohledně nabídky, vsazených ticketech. Rychlost odbavování WAL je kritická pro stabilitu nabídkové databáze a zajištění integrity dat. Proto je potřeba zajistit, aby se data (tisíce logů) zpracovála co nejrychleji. V peaku Replication Handler odbavoval až 20.000 logů za sekundu. Dalším krokem ve vývoji aplikace je zvýšení stability rozšířením automatických testů a refactoring za účelem optimalizace performance pomocí profilingu a tracingu.  Čeho budeš součástí? V rámci firmy jsme vytvořili komunitu, kterou nazýváme Go Guilda. Tvoří ji lidé napříč týmy, které alespoň okrajově zajímá Go. Sdílíme zde znalosti, best practices, společné code review, chyby, ze kterých jsme se poučili. Prostě vše ohledně Go. Momentálně uvažujeme o poskytování některých našich toolů/utilit jako open source. Naším cílem je vytvořit nejen komunitu pro Betsys, ale také vybudovat Go komunitu v Česku a nakonec třeba hostit i GopherCon CZ.  Co musíš umět a chtít? Dobré logické myšlení Ovládat základy Go – syntaxe, jak funguje, výhody a nevýhody, motivace Zkušenosti s vývojem produkčních BE aplikací v jiném jazyce Ochotu aktivně rozvíjet své znalosti a dovednosti  A co oceníme?
