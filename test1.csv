If you’re looking for a position where you can set your own hours, take holidays as you see fit, work remotely from home or anywhere in the world, and help medical research succeed, then please read on.  Today’s highly sophisticated medical system has added nearly 20 years of life expectancy, reduced infant mortality by 90% and maternal mortality by 99%. Polio, leprosy, smallpox, and tuberculosis are practically eradicated, even in the poorest countries in the world. More recently, medical researchers around the world have come together to create a variety of vaccines to combat Covid-19.

Our clients – academic researchers and medical research organizations, are working hard to continue to develop treatments and devices, increase our understanding, eradicate sickness, and improve quality of life. Their biggest challenge is spending half of their time searching for and never being able to recruit enough of the patients required for their clinical trials.  Our company – Trialfacts, removes the biggest hurdle and frustration to conducting their research, by recruiting the patients and volunteers they require for their clinical trials, and many times thereby saving their research. We’re the only company in the industry to also do this in a predictable and reliable manner, by determining upfront exactly how many patients we can recruit, and backing that up with a money-back guarantee.  We're looking for someone who can:  Write — At Trialfacts, we recruit volunteers and patients for our clients’ studies through our website as well as social media channels like Facebook. To do that, we need eye-catching and informative web ads, video ads, landing pages, and social media ads for each study we recruit for. You’ll be responsible for creating the promotional material for each study. You’ll also write up the questions we will use in the online questionnaire to determine whether or not a patient or volunteer is eligible for a study. Describe — For each study, the client will provide us with official study documentation such as Protocols and Information Consent Forms. These documents explain what the study is about and what is required of the volunteer. However, they typically use a lot of medical jargon that is difficult for the layman to understand. It will be your job to read through these documents, absorb the important stuff, and use them to create informative, accessible, and appealing descriptions of the studies for the volunteers and patients. To keep our ads fresh and our audiences interested, we'll need you to think outside the box and come up with a variety of ways to tell the same message. Research — In order to write relatable, appealing copy that is received well, you'll spend time researching the audience - whether it be Type 2 Diabetics who want to lose weight or healthy volunteers or teenagers diagnosed with depression.   Collaborate — You will be working closely with the Recruitment Team to create the best possible promotional material. Specifically, Megan, our Recruitment Manager, will help guide and train you and Anass, our Paid Advertising Specialist, will work with you to test what copy is the most effective.  What’s in it for you:  Autonomy — We don’t have set working hours. We don’t have a leave application process (you can take paid holidays whenever you want). We don’t micromanage or babysit. You’ll be accountable to the rest of the team purely on your results and not on the number of hours spent working.  Our team is remote (we communicate via Slack, Basecamp and video conferencing software). We set our own hours based on what works for us and our clients. As long as you have a good internet connection, you can work from wherever in the world you choose.  Innovation — We’ve launched innovative patient recruitment strategies (e.g. our phone screening appointment system, researcher interviews, social media recruitment), and we’re constantly improving our service. We have developed a data-driven forecasting approach that provides predictability in a volatile industry. Our consistent, data-driven process has allowed us to be the first and only recruitment company to provide certainty to our clients via a money-back guarantee.  It’s our data-driven approach and continuous focus on innovative patient recruitment strategies that allows us to help our clients successfully reach their goals.  Impact — Trialfacts plays an extremely important role in contributing to medical research and driving humanity forward. Our clients—researchers working at universities, pharmaceutical companies, biotech companies, natural medicine companies, hospitals and medical practices—work hard to develop treatments and technology that cure diseases and improve quality of life.  Growth — As a member of a small team you'll be exposed to many areas of the business. You'll be given the opportunity to learn many new skills and experiment in many new areas, as well as progress and build on what you already know. We’ll encourage you to test out new creative ideas and expand your copywriting skills. You'll have access to courses and training programs of your choice, paid for by Trialfacts. Each quarter we’ll put in place a training plan to increase your skills, knowledge, experience, and responsibility.  Opportunity — As a small and innovative team we’ve done away with outdated corporate thinking like the physical office, micromanaging and bureaucratic leave processes, but we haven’t thrown the baby out with the bathwater. We offer a stable monthly salary. You will also be eligible for a quarterly team bonus and an annual salary review. You will have the opportunity to develop your career with the possibility to grow into positions of additional responsibility and/or leadership in the future. The future looks optimistic as we continue to improve and expand on our core service.  This position is for you if you:  Excel at written communication — from landing page and web ad copy to communicating with the team, being able to write well is a must for any Trialfacts position, but especially for yours. Being in a remote team, you must also be great at communicating and comfortable sharing your thoughts - whether it be in Slack or during a team meeting on Zoom. At times you will even use screenshare software (like Loom) to explain a concept or provide feedback. Are able to create compelling copy for promotional material — after synthesizing large amounts of information you need to be able to have a natural ability to be able to put yourself in the relevant person’s shoes to be able to create effective copy for web ads, video ads, landing pages, questionnaires and social media ads. You're excellent at summarizing the key points to communicate about a study. Are able to translate medical jargon into layman's terms— you're not intimidated by terms like 'stomach-emptying', anticoagulant, Borborygmi and Choledocholithiasis and are able to quickly explain them in simple language. Can write in American and Australian English — you're expected to know the difference and adapt your writing accordingly. Are highly organized — you'll be writing several promotional materials for various studies every week. If you're not highly organized and comfortable in a fast-paced environment, then you're not a good-fit for this role. Are flexible — in an entrepreneurial business we sometimes have to wear different hats. We're looking for someone who takes ownership and wants to help grow our company. If you're the kind of person who would rather sit back and say ""that's not my responsibility"" then please don't apply. Are tech savvy — you must be 100% comfortable with using online work tools like Slack, Basecamp, Pipedrive, Helpscout, Loom, Google Docs, and more. Love learning— we're a team that's driven by learning and improving. We're looking for someone who wants to learn and develop their professional skills, grow as a person, and constantly improve the service that we provide. Are results-driven— you will be coached and guided, but ultimately you will be responsible for your performance. Are looking for a full-time position— we’re experiencing growth and we need someone who can fully commit to Trialfacts and get up to speed quickly. We’re not looking for someone who has their own part-time business or freelancing career on the side. ",,Full-time,,
